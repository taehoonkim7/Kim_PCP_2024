## Phylogenomic analysis

1. `SynNet` was generated following [SynNet-Pipeline](https://github.com/zhaotao1987/SynNet-Pipeline).
2. `NAC.SynNet` was generated by `python Filter_SynNet.py NAC_prot.txt SynNet NAC.SynNet`.

    * Relevant files available in *Phylogenomic* folder:

        ```bash
        Filter_SynNet.py
        NAC_prot.txt
        NAC.SynNet
        ```

3. `NAC.SynNet` was used as input file for phylogenomic profiling following [SynNet-Pipeline](https://github.com/zhaotao1987/SynNet-Pipeline).

    * Relevant files available in *Phylogenomic* folder:

        ```bash
        NAC.infomap.r #modified from infomap.r
        NAC.Phylogenomic_Profiling.r #modified from Phylogenomic_Profiling.r
        ```

    * Relevant figures:
        * **Fig5A**
